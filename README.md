Contributing
---------------------
We appreciate any contribution to Subrion, whether it is related to bugs, grammar, or simply a suggestion or improvement.
However, we ask that any contributions follow our simple guidelines in order to be properly received.

What you mainly want to know is that:

- All the main activity happens in the `develop` branch. Any pull request should be addressed only to that branch. We will not consider pull requests made to the `master`.
- It's very well appreciated, and highly suggested, to start a new feature whenever you want to make changes or add new functionality. It will make it much easier for us to just checkout your feature branch and test it, before merging it into `develop`
